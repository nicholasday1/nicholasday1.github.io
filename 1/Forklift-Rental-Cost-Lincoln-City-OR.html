Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

Even if that's not you, be honest.</p>
<p>Toyota's industrial vehicle and equipment business started in March 1956 with lift truck production and sales in Japan.
