<h3>Material Handling Lift, Capacity Edcouch TX 78538</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity.

The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>

Rated capacity reduced for load centers greater than 24 in. and lift heights greater than 13 ft. For leaf sprung, solid-axled vehicles, pinion wedges should be installed between the axle and spring pack to compensate for the driveshaft angle by rotating the differential housing up, making for a clean pinion angle on the differential side.</p>
