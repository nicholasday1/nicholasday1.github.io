<p>For loads exceeding 2500kg, a motorized pallet jack, "walkie stacker" or Forklift is recommended. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. Identify the maximum load weight you need to lift, and rent a forklift that could support such capacity. The Black Widow is a professionally lifted truck by SCA Performance.</p>
<p>Texas First Rentals San Antonio is a sister company of HOLT CAT®, the largest Caterpillar dealer in the United States. Body Lift Kit: If you're interested in getting more off-road capabilities but are still on a somewhat limited budget, go the middle ground with a body lift kit, which includes adding spacers between the body and frame to give you more space for off-road tires.</p>

As the name suggests, the reach forklift is primarily designed to pick up loads high in racking or storage.</p>
<p>These abilities made rough terrain forklifts vital on farms and construction sites. This course has been designed to introduce workers to the forklift they'll be operating, what it's capable of, learn it's limitations, and train them on how to operate it properly. Growth of the Pallet Trucks market is predominantly driven by the development of large-scale industrial projects in developing economies of South East Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, India and China.</p>
