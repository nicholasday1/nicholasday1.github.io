<p>These sit-down rough terrain forklifts have all been checked upon purchase to determine that they are in good working order. The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required. When a 15,500 lb. forklift isn't enough, you'll need a high-capacity cushion forklift to get the job done.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>Shall be located with the center of gravity centered 10 inches above the compressed operator's seat for sit-down trucks and centered 40 inches above the operator's platform for stand-up trucks. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>
