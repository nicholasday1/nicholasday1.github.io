An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.

<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies.
