For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
