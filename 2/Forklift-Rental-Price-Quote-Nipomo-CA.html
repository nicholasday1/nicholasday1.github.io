<h2>Doosan Announces Industrial Lift Truck As New Dealer In Nipomo </h2>
<p>According to a report from the Industrial Truck Association (ITA), more than a quarter million units were sold, representing a 2.8% increase from 2017. With the installation of a suspension lift, however, you can get a lot greater clearance. Mono Tube shocks with reservoir cylinder are constructed with off-road attitude and performance in mind. All terrain forklifts allow you to work in places where traditional forklifts cannot go. Rough terrain environments don't have to slow you down with Access Hire's range of all-terrain forklifts that offer greater maneuverability and keep the machine moving in the roughest of applications.</p>
<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out.

The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>

<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Decrease speed at all corners, sound horn and watch the swing of both the rear of the lift truck and the load. On the other hand, they can be less stable when turning with loads and have a limited capacity range. Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. This class of forklift is one of the most common, and what ones tend to picture when thinking of a forklift's appearance.</p>
