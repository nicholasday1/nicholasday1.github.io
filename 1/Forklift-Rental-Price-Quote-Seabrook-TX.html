Hand Pallet Truck with Scale is an excellent economic solution for all weighing requirements in busy warehouse environments , which allows you to weigh cargo where you want and when you want. If any of the foregoing trucks is equipped with attachments, the rated capacity shall be expressed in pounds at a specified load center and for a specified load elevation.</p>
