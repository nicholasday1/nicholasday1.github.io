Rough terrain forklifts are used for areas that need the maximum amount of traction to transport inventory safely. To avoid accidents, the operator should always remember to stack the loads evenly across the pallet and that they are balanced. With no mast blocking the view ahead like on conventional forklifts, the Teletruk's unique side boom provides unrivalled forward visibility.</p>
