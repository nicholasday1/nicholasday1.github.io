<p>Types of jobs where you might encounter rough terrain forklifts are lumber yards, builders, brick yards, land movers, construction workers, etc. Product-line features: Each of the four current Xtreme straight-mast forklifts offers choices in their mast, carriage and fork configurations, as well as such options and accessories as fourth function valves, a load cushion hydraulic system, a work-light package, a rotating beacon and mirrors.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
