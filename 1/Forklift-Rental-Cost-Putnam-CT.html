Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>Pro Comp offers a selection of lift kits for almost every major make and model truck or suv. A little bigger than a 5,000 lb. truck, the 6,000 lb. electric 4-wheel has a different frame and larger battery compartment. Trade Machines offers a wide selection of used machinery, including all types of forklifts. From new and used forklifts and compact construction equipment to rentals, repairs, and parts, we're your complete quality experts.</p>
