<h2>Important Considerations Before You Sign A Forklift Rental Agreement Highland </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height.
