Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking.

<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain. When you rent a forklift from Gregory Poole Lift Systems, you get the adaptability you need from your forklift fleet, without a huge impact on your bottom line.

<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents.

Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. The pallet trucks may be manual or battery-powered.
