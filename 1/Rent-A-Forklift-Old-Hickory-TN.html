<p>With the rise in popularity of the telehandler, the rough-terrain (RT) forklift has become the lower-cost, more-maneuverable alternative on construction sites.

<p>These machines are designed to work where the going gets rough, as their name implies. Hyster-Yale Materials is another such company that ha made a huge contribution to an increase in the global lift trucks market size. Adoption of forklifts for lifting various types of materials, such as steel, wood, and mortar, by the construction industry to transfer heavy goods and reduce mishandling is driving industry growth.</p>
