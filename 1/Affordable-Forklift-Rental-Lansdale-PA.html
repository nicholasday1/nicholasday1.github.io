<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck.

<h3>Stand Up Forklift Lansdale PA</h3>
<p>While standard counterbalance forklifts need a good amount of space to make turns, a three-wheel forklift can actually spin in a very tight circle.

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>They can weather any environment and derive fuel from multiple sources, but they do not have the unique capacities that reach forklifts do.
