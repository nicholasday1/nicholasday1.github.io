Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again.

It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>

<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,” allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase. These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity.
