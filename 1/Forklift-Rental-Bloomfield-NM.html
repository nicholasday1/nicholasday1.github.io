The second hand forklifts, offered by us, for buying and selling purposes are in fine working condition and thus, require minimum maintenance.</p>

<p>Rough terrain forklifts can have a vertical tower, which lifts loads straight up, or a telescoping boom, which lifts loads up and out from the base of the machine. Maini's floor transportation range enables effortless transfer of heavy loads in your shop floors and warehouses. Motorized pallet jacks or manual pallet jacks are found in nearly every warehouse and are essential in many manufacturing and distribution work environments.</p>
<p>Report damaged or excessively worn pallet jacks. Choose a jack pallet scale from METTLER TOLEDO that will withstand regularly heavy industrial use. The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>A reliable alternative to the Stainless Lifter is the BT Lifter Galvanized LHM230G model with stainless steel axles and galvanized chassis and pump. Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet.
