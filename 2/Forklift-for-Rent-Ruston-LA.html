From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series order pickers are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision.

Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>
<p>Therefore owing to the communication advancements, the growth for the connected Forklift Trucks will gain traction over the forecast period. Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again. With longer shift life, proven diagnostics, and a global parts and service network, users of the Crown SP Series high-level order pickers are sure to experience more satisfaction, longer forklift life and lower total costs.</p>
