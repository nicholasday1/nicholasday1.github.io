Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved.
