Rental provides the means to obtain the latest technology improving operator satisfaction, WH&S and overall efficiencies.

The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>The majority of all rough terrain forklifts will have pneumatic tires since they are designed for traveling outdoors, such as on gravel or in yard work.

<p>However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities.
