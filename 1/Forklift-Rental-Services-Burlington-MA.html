<h3>Forklift Regulations Burlington MA</h3>
<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>JCB - dependable performance meets exceptional value with JCB's line of rough terrain forklifts. OSHA has developed several training, compliance assistance, and health and safety recognition programs throughout its history. Masts are built based on the lifting height provided and can be: double, with two telescopic bodies that extend when lifting begins; double with full free lifting, in which, unlike for the previous type, the telescopic mast does not extend until the fork has been completely raised; and triple, with three telescopic bodies.</p>
