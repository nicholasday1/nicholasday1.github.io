Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains. The operator stands in a sideways compartment and the side loader unloads objects on its side. When we start talking about lifting trucks, lift kits, etc.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>JCB - dependable performance meets exceptional value with JCB's line of rough terrain forklifts. OSHA has developed several training, compliance assistance, and health and safety recognition programs throughout its history. Masts are built based on the lifting height provided and can be: double, with two telescopic bodies that extend when lifting begins; double with full free lifting, in which, unlike for the previous type, the telescopic mast does not extend until the fork has been completely raised; and triple, with three telescopic bodies.</p>

Most rough-terrain forklift models have gasoline- or diesel-powered engines, but some models run on propane. Forks that are meant to carry the load are attached to the main body of the forklift by a pair of roller chain pulleys whose fulcrum forms a gear at the top of the mast.</p>
