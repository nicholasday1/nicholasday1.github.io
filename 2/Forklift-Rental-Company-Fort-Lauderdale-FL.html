<p>All parts are made of stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin, and bolt, etc. Warehouses and fulfillment centers with tall and deep racking commonly use reach trucks. You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in.
