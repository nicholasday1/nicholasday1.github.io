<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. We only sell the very best, and we want Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Orange County drivers to know it. Give us a call at 877-772-3022 if you have any questions or have an interest in learning more about these trucks. OSHA Section 1910.178 lists safety procedures for fork trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, motorized hand trucks, and other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or internal combustion engines.” The most important rule is that each forklift reaches the basic standards for safety.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking.

The most maneuverable of the bunch, and also one of the most fun to operate, reach trucks are designed for warehouse applications and other locations that routinely stack palletized goods in racking or other storage areas.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights. The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
