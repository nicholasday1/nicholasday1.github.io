In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013.

If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>Powerhouses like the Ford F-150 already command the road, but lifted trucks provide that extra level of customization that demand attention.
