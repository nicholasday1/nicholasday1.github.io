<h3>10 Ton Forklift Marblehead MA</h3>
<p>If you're an adventurous individual or desire a truck with serious size and power, then you definitely should test drive one of our lifted trucks. Per your express consent, all information collected on this form (including but not limited to name, contact information and location data) will be used for communication purposes only relating to products and services offered by Ahern Rentals.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
