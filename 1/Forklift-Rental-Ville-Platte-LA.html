The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment.

<p>Our selection of rental equipment comes from leading brands that are trusted around the globe to deliver products that meet the highest quality standards. If you are looking to carry loads cross-country with a highly stable machine, then these forklifts are ideal. But the counterweight is larger and usually of a different design, to increase the lifting capacity.</p>
